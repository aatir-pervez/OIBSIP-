# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Objective
To build a regression model to predict car selling prices based on features like year, present price, fuel type, transmission, and owner details.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset
2. Dropped unnecessary column (Car_Name)
3. Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated using R² score and Mean Absolute Error
7. Visualized actual vs predicted prices

## Result
R² Score: ~0.85
Mean Absolute Error: ~1.21
